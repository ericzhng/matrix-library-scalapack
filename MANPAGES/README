ScaLAPACK, version 1.7
DATE:  August 31, 2001

To install the ScaLAPACK documentation, do the following:

1) Copy the ScaLAPACK manual pages to the desired location.  This
   will probably be /usr/local/man/manl or other.dir/man/manl.

   % cp man/manl/* /usr/local/man/manl

   Be aware that if the manpages are installed in some directory
   other than /usr/local/man/manl you will need to add that directory
   to your MANPATH environment variable.  First type:

   % echo $MANPATH
   
   If it says that MANPATH is undefined, type:

   % setenv MANPATH /usr/man:/usr/local/man:/user_path/man_dir

   Otherwise, if MANPATH is defined, type:

   % setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:/user_path/man_dir

   where man_dir is the directory of manual pages containing /man/manl.

   ('%' is assumed to be your shell prompt.)

2) Add the ScaLAPACK manual pages to the whatis database for keyword
   searching via 'man -k':

   % catman -w -M /usr/local/man 

   or

   % catman -w -M other.dir/man

3) Test out the installation.  First make sure your current shell
   knows about the installation:

   % rehash

   Now test out the manual pages:

   % man pdgetrf

   You should get the man page for pdgetrf.  BE AWARE that your request
   should be in lower case.
